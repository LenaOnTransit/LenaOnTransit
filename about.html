        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Hi! My name is Lena and I am an 18 year old girl, born boy who found out they were way too feminine for manhood :3</p>

        <p>My parents called me Colin, after... idk they just liked how it sounded? It's not like they were big fans of Colin Farrell or anything. I don't know, I never asked. I certainly hope thats not why they called me Colin lol.</p>

        <p>anyway I decided to change my name to Lena because it's a lot more feminine and I like it a lot more. I just saw the name once and was like "holy shit this is it"</p>

        <p>I have always liked to tinker around with software and it's what inspired me to create my own website. to annoy the internet with my silly stuff.</p>

        <p>I will be updating this website whenever I do new silly stuff <3</p>
